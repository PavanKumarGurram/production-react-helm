# ADR 001: Frontend Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a modern, maintainable, and performant frontend architecture for our application.

## Decision
We will use:
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Automated testing with Vitest and Playwright
- Container-based deployment with Kubernetes

## Consequences
### Positive
- Strong type safety with TypeScript
- Fast development cycles with Vite
- Consistent styling with Tailwind
- Reliable deployments with containers
- Comprehensive testing coverage

### Negative
- Learning curve for TypeScript
- Initial setup complexity
- Container orchestration overhead
